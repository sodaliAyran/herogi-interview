<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is a single page including a backend, a frontend and a database. The problem was to create a single page web application with the provided data that does the following:
* Runners based on their average pace. (Time(minute) per kilometer)
* Provide sorting functionality based on average pace, distance and total time
* Also include username, age, gender in the UI

Also there was a Bonus points section with the following:
* An option to group users by their age group (group1: 20-30, group2: 30-40, group3: 40 - 60) -> Which I did
* Use React --> Which I also did
* Use Scala --> That is something I won't do for extra points.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
